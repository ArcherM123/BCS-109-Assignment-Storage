The strengths and weaknesses of accuracy, precision, and recall are that, accuracy is best used when trying to determine whether or not the presented value is equal to the true value, while precision is best used trying to find a particular value among multiple presented values, and recall is best used when trying to determine how many values are equal to the true value in comparison to the total number of values.
